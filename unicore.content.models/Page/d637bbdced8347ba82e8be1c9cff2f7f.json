  "content": "Diarrhoea is the second most common cause of death in young children, after\npneumonia. About 4 billion cases of diarrhoea are estimated to occur every\nyear among children under 5. It kills more than 1.5 million children under 5\nyears of age every year, representing 17 per cent of all deaths in children\nunder 5. Children are more likely than adults to die from diarrhoea because\nthey become dehydrated and malnourished more quickly. Diarrhoea is caused by\ngerms that are swallowed, especially germs from faeces. This happens most\noften where there is unsafe disposal of faeces, poor hygiene practices, lack\nof clean drinking water, or when infants are not breastfed. Infants who are\nexclusively breastfed in their first six months and who receive all their\nimmunizations on time are less likely to get diarrhoea. Children with\ndiarrhoea should be given lots of fluids and foods along with a special\nsolution called oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc to help reduce the\nseverity of the illness. Families and communities, with support from\ngovernments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), can do much to raise\nawareness of 1) what causes diarrhoea, 2) why it is important to treat\ndiarrhoea as soon as it starts, and 3) how to prevent the conditions that\ncause it. When everyone works together to reduce diarrhoea, children's right\nto life, survival, health and development can be better assured.\n\n",
