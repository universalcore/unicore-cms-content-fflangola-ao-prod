  "content": "Many parents do not take a child to be immunized because the child has a\nfever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However, it is safe to\nimmunize a child who has a minor illness.\n\nIt is also safe to immunize a child who has a disability or is malnourished.\nIf a child is HIV-positive or suspected to be HIV-positive, a trained health\nworker should be consulted about which vaccines to give the child.\n\nAfter an injection, the child may cry or develop a fever, a minor rash or a\nsmall sore. This is normal and shows that the vaccine is working. Children\nunder 6 months of age should breastfeed frequently; older children should be\ngiven plenty of liquids and foods. If the child develops a high fever (over 38\ndegrees Celsius) the child should be taken to a trained health worker or\nhealth centre.\n\nMeasles can be extremely dangerous for malnourished children, so they should\nbe immunized against measles, especially if the malnutrition is severe.\n\n",
