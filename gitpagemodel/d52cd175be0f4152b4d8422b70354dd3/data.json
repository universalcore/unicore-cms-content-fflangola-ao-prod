        "content": "When children are sick, such as when they have diarrhoea, measles or\npneumonia, their appetite decreases and their body uses food less effectively.\nIf the child is sick several times a year, his or her growth will slow or\nstop. It is very important to encourage a sick child to eat. This can be\ndifficult, as children who are ill may not be hungry. The parent or other\ncaregiver should keep offering foods the child likes, a little at a time and\nas often as possible. Extra breastfeeding is especially important since it can\nprovide nutrients required for recovery from infections. It is essential to\nencourage a sick child to drink as often as possible. Dehydration (lack of\nfluids in the body) is a serious problem for children with diarrhoea. Drinking\nplenty of liquids will help prevent dehydration. When a child has diarrhoea,\ngiving him or her oral rehydration salts (ORS) dissolved in clean water, along\nwith foods and liquids, can help prevent dehydration. Giving the child a zinc\nsupplement every day for 10-14 days can reduce the severity of the diarrhoea.\nThe child is not fully recovered from an illness until he or she weighs about\nas much as when the illness began. A child can die from persistent diarrhoea\nif it is not treated quickly. If diarrhoea and poor appetite persist for more\nthan a few days, the mother, father or other caregiver needs to consult a\ntrained health worker.
