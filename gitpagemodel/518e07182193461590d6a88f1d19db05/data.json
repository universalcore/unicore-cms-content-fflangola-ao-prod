To prevent children from drowning,\nparents and other caregivers should always closely supervise children who are\nnear or in the water.' **Where there is water, it is important to:** * cover\nwells and water tanks so children cannot open them * turn tubs and buckets\nupside down when not in use, and always supervise children taking a bath *\nteach children to stay away from ditches and drains * for families who live\nnear bodies of water, install a fence around the house and close the gates to\nprevent young children from going in the water * fence ponds and pools with\nvertical rails spaced close together to prevent children from getting through\nthem to the water * for families who live directly on the water, put vertical\nbars on terraces, windows and doors to prevent young children from falling in\nthe water * teach children how to swim when they are young * have young\nchildren and children who cannot swim wear an approved flotation device (life\njacket) when playing in the water or on a boat * always supervise children who\nare swimming * teach children never to swim in fast-flowing streams and never\nto swim alone * in flood-prone areas, carefully watch children when the water\nbegins to rise; make sure that all family members, including children old\nenough to understand, are well informed of safe places to go to if they need\nto leave the home quickly.
